# Nightlife-Backend
An AWS Java backend that provides the basic functionality of a social media website. Demonstrates best principles for organizing large amounts of code.

This repository contains lambdas that hold the business logic for the back end of a fake social media website. These lambdas are invoked by API gateways
that are called by the front end. The back end was hosted on AWS, and used DynamoDB as its database.
